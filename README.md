# MonitorSuspciousActivitiesOnNetwork

# Description:

Developed a robust network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system using Python and Scapy. This system captures and analyzes real-time network packets to identify suspicious activities such as high traffic volumes, port scanning, communications with unknown IP addresses, and suspiciously large UDP payloads. The project leverages an SQLite database to log network traffic and alerts, providing a comprehensive view of network activities and potential security threats.

# Key Features:

Real-time packet capture and analysis using Scapy.
Detection of network anomalies including high traffic volume and port scanning.
Identification of communication with unknown IPs.
Logging of network activities and alerts in an SQLite database.
Modular and scalable design for easy integration with existing security infrastructures.
This project demonstrates a practical application of network security principles and showcases proficiency in Python programming, network protocols, and database management. It highlights the ability to design and implement solutions that enhance network security and monitoring capabilities.

# Key Responsibilities:

Designed and implemented a system to capture and analyze network packets in real-time.
Developed algorithms to detect and log suspicious network activities.
Integrated an SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval of network data.
Ensured the scalability and modularity of the system for future enhancements.
Conducted testing and debugging to ensure system reliability and accuracy.
